#  Rust Crash Course

Grasp the fundamentals of programming in Rust and put your knowledge to use.

This is the repository for [ Rust Crash Course
](https://bpbonline.com/products/rust-crash-course?_pos=1&_sid=29642ae85&_ss=r),published by BPB Publications. 

## About the Book
Rust is a sophisticated systems programming language for speed, memory safety, and parallelism. This book gives you a fast introduction to Rust so that you may get started with low-level system programming and developing web applications, network services, and embedded programmes.

The book begins with instructions on setting up the Rust environment, developing a "hello world" programme, and getting started with cargo, the Rust package manager and the build tool. The book is a crash course, although it covers fundamental programming principles like variables and mutability, data types, comments, and control flow. Very precisely, topics such as ownership, borrowing, structs, enums, and other collections are covered. Error handling, memory management, and concurrency are well-demonstrated using practical projects. The book explains how to construct automated tests, write multithreaded applications, and utilise common data structures without difficulty. The book concludes with several hands-on projects, including creating a CLI application, a web app, a binary image classifier, and an embedded programme.

After reading this book, you will have a thorough understanding of the principles of Rust programming and be able to produce idiomatic Rust code for your projects, as well as improved tests and documentation.
